# Group T mobile robotics

Welcome the the group T mobile robotics github! This repository contains example code for mobile robotics courses at KU Leuven campus group T, more specifically for the autonomous vehicles and embedded control systems courses. As well as documentation about this code and the robot platforms. To get started, take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/RobinAmsters/GT_mobile_robotics/wiki), which contains general and course specific information. 

Both this code repository and the wiki are currently maintained by Robin Amsters (robin.amsters@kuleuven.be).
