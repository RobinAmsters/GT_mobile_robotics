%% INTRODUCTION
%   To start using a turtlebot 3 following procedure
%   needs to be followed:
%
%   1) Turn the TB3 on.
%   2) Set up the putty SSH connection (IP adress is given)
%   3) Type "bringup".
%   4) You are now able to run your MATLAB code
%
% This file file load in a map and localize the robot by fitting current
% laser scan measurements to this map with a particle filter (PF). 
% The results are fused with odometry (dead reckoning) by a Kalman filter.
% All results are plotted at the end, whilst driving, particle filter
% results are also shown.
